Otherwise we would have to define an entirely new function each time we defined a slightly different objective or constraint in one of our scenarios, which would get tedious and messy. The tedium and mess would be more evident if we had a large number of alternative scenarios defined in the same notebook (which we do not here, but use your imagination). \n",

    "Note also that the expected data structures for the various args to `ForestModel.add_problem` must be matched exactly or `ws3` will likely crash somewhere in one of the series of complicated private optimization model-building methods that get called from `ForestModel.add_problem`. You _should not_ have to unpack the exact logic of this model-building code to figure out why your model is crashing... it really is quite complicated and hard to follow. If you model is crashing there, you probably fed invalid (or incorrectly structured) args to `ForestModel.add_problem`. Carefully review the structure and values of your args to find the problem. I left some notes below (and some comments in the `_gen_scen_base` function code) to help clarify the expected arg structure, and will work on expanding the docstrings in the `ws3` source code so this is less obscure going forward.\n",

For some reason the latest `dev` branch of `ws3` on GitHub was in some sort of intermediate state between using _periods_ and _years_ as the age unit. Originally `ws3` was implemented to import and simulate legacy Woodstock model input datasets, so it used _periods_ as the age unit (like Woodstock). At some point I think I hastily patched `ws3` to use _years_ as the age unit to make it work with `spades_ws3` for specific projects that needed to get done and delivered... if I recall we set the period length to 1 year for all those projects so it \"just worked\", but now we have a bit of a mess. Oops. Ultimately, I will need to revert `ws3` back to using Woodstock-compatible _period_ age unit (but make sure that the `spatial` module can still spatially and temporally disaggregate the aspatial periodic solutions from the Model I LP optimization problems into year-length time slices (maybe with age optionally expressed in years in output from this, for compatibility with downstream linked models like `SpaDES`). This is just a side-effect of many iterations of re-purposing `ws3` to work in a long (ad hoc) sequence of real research projects that had very specific input and output data specs. It is actually remarkable that `ws3` is not _more_ of a mess than it currently is, given the history and essentially null development budget. Use"
